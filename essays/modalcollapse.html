<p>List of assumptions made when dealing with the principle of sufficient reason:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Principle of Sufficient Reason this argument considers is the following: any plurality of contingent truths has a full ground</p>
</li>
<li><p>If some facts Fs collectively ground some facts Gs, then necessarily, if each fact among Fs obtains, then each fact among Gs obtains</p>
</li>
<li><p>A plurality of truths are contingently true if and only if at least one of them is contingently true</p>
</li>
<li><p>A plurality of truths are necessarily true if and only if each of them is necessarily true.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cs refers to all contingent truths, not the set of them but all of them at the same time</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cs successfully refers since there is at least one contingent truth</p>
</li>
<li><p>any plurality of truths with at least one contingent truth among them are contingent</p>
</li>
<li><p>General Irreflexivity (GI): for any Xs and Ys, if Xs and Ys overlap, then Xs are not the full ground of Ys</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-i-argument-i-"><i>Argument:</i></h2>
<p>P1. There is at least one contingent truth</p>
<p>P2. Let ‘Cs’ collectively denote the contingent truths</p>
<p>P3. Cs are contingent</p>
<p>P4. So Cs have a sufficient reason, Rs</p>
<p>P5. Rs are either contingent or necessary</p>
<p>P6. If Rs are necessary, then Cs are necessary, since grounding induces entailment.</p>
<p>P7. If Rs are contingent, they are either disjoint or overlap Cs</p>
<p>P8. If they are disjoint, Rs would be necessary so they cannot be disjoint with Cs and contingent</p>
<p>P9. If Rs are contingent, they either just are Cs or Rs overlaps Cs</p>
<p>P10. If Rs just are Cs, they cannot be the full ground of Cs</p>
<p>P11. If Rs are contingent, they overlap Cs</p>
<p>P12. By GI, If Rs are contingent, they do are not the full ground of Cs</p>
<p>P13. That would contradict Rs being the sufficient reason of Cs</p>
<p>P14. Rs cannot be contingent</p>
<p>P15. Rs are necessary</p>
<p>P16. Cs are necessary</p>
<p>C. All contingent truths are necessary</p>
