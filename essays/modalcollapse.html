<h2 id="-i-assumptions-i-">Assumptions:</h2>

<p>List of assumptions made when dealing with the principle of sufficient reason:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>The Principle of Sufficient Reason this argument considers is the following: any plurality of contingent truths has a full ground.</p></li>
        <li><p>If some facts Fs collectively ground some facts Gs, then necessarily, if each fact among Fs obtains, then each fact among Gs obtains.</p></li>
        <li><p>A plurality of truths are contingently true if and only if at least one of them is contingently true.</p></li>
        <li><p>A plurality of truths are necessarily true if and only if each of them is necessarily true.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cs refers to all contingent truths.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cs successfully refers since there is at least one contingent truth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Any plurality of truths with at least one contingent truth among them are contingent.</p></li>
        <li><p>General Irreflexivity (GI): for any Xs and Ys, if Xs and Ys overlap, then Xs are not the full ground of Ys.</p></li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="-i-argument-i-">Argument:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>There is at least one contingent truth</li>
        <li>Let ‘Cs’ collectively denote the contingent truths</li>
        <li>Cs are contingent</li>
        <li>So Cs have a sufficient reason, Rs</li>
        <li>Rs are either contingent or necessary</li>
        <li>If Rs are necessary, then Cs are necessary, since grounding induces entailment.</li>
        <li>If Rs are contingent, they are either disjoint or overlap Cs</li>
        <li>If they are disjoint, Rs would be necessary so they cannot be disjoint with Cs and contingent</li>
        <li>If Rs are contingent, they either just are Cs or Rs overlap Cs</li>
        <li>If Rs just are Cs, they cannot be the full ground of Cs</li>
        <li>If Rs are contingent, they overlap Cs</li>
        <li>By GI, If Rs are contingent, they do are not the full ground of Cs</li>
        <li>That would contradict Rs being the sufficient reason of Cs</li>
        <li>Rs cannot be contingent</li>
        <li>Rs are necessary</li>
        <li>Cs are necessary</li>
    </ol>

<p><strong>C. All contingent truths are necessary</strong></p>
<p>Original paper this argument is sourced from is <a href="http://www.krismcdaniel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PSRAN.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Counter-Argument:</h2>
<p>The argument above requires that there exists a set of contingent facts, but who is to say that Cs successfully refers? Consider an argument that Tomaszewski gives against the existence of such a set in <em>The Principle of Sufficient Reason Defended: There Is No Conjunction of All Contingently True Propositions</em>.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>There is a conjunction of all contingently true propositions, P. (Assumed)</li>
        <li>For each non-empty collection of propositions which are conjuncts of P, there is a unique contingently true proposition to which it corresponds. (Premise)</li>
        <li>Every such contingently true proposition is a conjunct of P. (From 1)</li>
        <li>There are strictly more non-empty collections of propositions which are conjuncts of P than there are propositions which are conjuncts of P. (From Cantor’s theorem)</li>
        <li>There are strictly more propositions which are conjuncts of P than there are propositions which are conjuncts of P. (From 2, 3 and 4). ⊥</li>
    </ol>

<p><strong>C. Therefore, there is no conjunction of all contingently true propositions.</strong></p>
<p>We should reject P4; Cantor's theorem doesn't apply to Proper Classes, so let us say there is a proper class of contingent facts that successfully refers.</p>
