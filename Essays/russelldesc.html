<h2 id="i-introduction-">I. Introduction.</h2>
<p>What is the difference between the following strings?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“I took a plane to Australia.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“That dog is ugly.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“dsihufdas laiojr afdzxc.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two sentences are meaningful, and because they’re meaningful, they mean something in particular. We may ask in virtue of what are the first two sentences meaningful while the last two are not? Is it the truth value of the sentences? Clearly not, I’ve never taken a plane to Australia so that would be false, but the sentence is still meaningful. I can parse it perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because the sentences are composed of individual terms that have meaning. No, that doesn’t seem to be the case either. “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.” doesn’t seem like a meaningful string even though each individual term seems to have meaning, however, it does seem like all meaningful sentences are made up of individual components that have meaning. It may be the case that each term in a sentence being meaningful is a necessary but not sufficient component of the whole string being meaningful. </p>
<p>With this, we’re given the data that require explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are some strings that are meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meaningful strings are composed of individual terms that are meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are strings that are composed entirely of individual terms that are meaningful without the string as a whole being meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meaningful strings mean specific particular things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an immediate common sense theory that explains these facts, a Referential theory of meaning.</p>
<h2 id="ii-referential-theory-of-meaning-and-objections-">II. Referential Theory of Meaning and Objections.</h2>
<p>On a Referential Theory of meaning, words have meanings because they are stand-ins for existing things. They’re just labels, a string that denote or refer to items in the world: “Dog” refers to dogs, “Arizona Ice Tea” refers to a really good drink, etc. Consider the following sentence, “The hunter killed the deer.“ It&#39;s going to represent the hunter killing the deer in virtue of “The hunter” denoting a hunter, “the deer” denoting a deer, and “killed” denoting some relation of killing a thing. A sentence gets its meaning solely from the state of affairs it describes. However problems arise on this view.</p>
<h3 id="1-problem-of-reference-to-non-existents">1. Problem of reference to Non-Existents</h3>
<p>Not all words name or denote actual existing objects. There are names for non-existent objects like “Odysseus” or “Pegasus”. If the meaning of a word is the name it denotes, the term “Pegasus” has no meaning because it doesn’t denote anything. There is no winged horse in reality. But surely there are meaningful sentences that utilize the term “Pegasus”. “Pegasus doesn’t exist” seems meaningful or how about the sentence “I saw Nobody”? Nobody by its very nature doesn’t denote or name a thing, but the sentence still seems meaningful.</p>
<p>There also exist words that grammatically are nouns but neither name individual things nor kinds of things, not even non-existent things. Consider some examples Quine gives, “sake,“ “behalf,“ and “dint.” Despite being nouns, words like these don’t seem to have meaning in virtue of referring to some particular object or kind of object.</p>
<p>There are other words in sentences besides nouns that don’t refer in any way, think of the following words: “and,” “a,“ “very,“ “hey,” and “the” are a few examples. These words do seem to be meaningful and occur often in sentences that competent speakers of English understand.</p>
<p>Consider the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Odysseus is clever.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this sentence, the following set of statements cannot be true of the sentence on pain of contradiction.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>P1.) The sentence is meaningful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>P2.) The sentence is a subject-predicate sentence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>P3.) A meaningful subject-predicate sentence is meaningful only in virtue of its picking out some individual thing and ascribing some property to that thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>P4.) The sentence’s subject term fails to pick out or denote something that actually exists</p>
</li>
<li><p>P5.) If the sentence is meaningful only in virtue of picking out a thing and ascribing a property to that thing (P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3) and if the sentences subject term fails to pick out anything that exists (P4) then either the sentence isn’t meaningful (¬P1) or the sentence picks out a thing that doesn’t exist. (¬P6) (P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3 ∧ P4  ⇒ [¬P1 ∨ ¬P6])</p>
</li>
<li><p>P6.) There is no such thing as a “non-existent thing”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, All of P1-P6 seem true. P1 seems uncontroversial as the sentence seems meaningful. P2 also seems true, the sentence is in a subject-predicate form. P4 is an obvious fact, Odysseus doesn’t exist so the subject term fails to denote something that exists. P5 is trivial. P6 also seems true but Meinong famously (and controversially) rejects P6 insisting possible objects of thought have a being despite not existing. This seems implausible though. Leaving us with P3 to be rejected.</p>
<h3 id="2-problem-of-identity">2. Problem of Identity</h3>
<p>Consider the following identity statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This statement consists of two singular terms, both of which denote the same person, and an identity relation between them. In light of that, it seems this sentence is trying to say that that person is that person, a trivial statement. It would say no more than “Mark Twain is Mark Twain”. The problem is the sentence seems non-trivial, having a different cognitive value than “Mark Twain is Mark Twain”. The sentence is first and foremost informative. You might learn something new upon reading it. The sentence is also contingent, it seems that reality could have been otherwise. Clemens may have never written under the name Mark Twain. It seems that at least one of the singular terms in the sentence contributes some meaning other than its referent.</p>
<h3 id="3-problem-of-substitution">3. Problem of Substitution</h3>
<p>Since the function of a singular term is to pick out an individual thing, even if one doesn’t accept a Referential Theory of meaning entirely, it does make some sense that singular terms might have meaning in virtue of the denoting role singular terms hold. We would expect that any two singular terms that denote the same thing would be equivalent in meaning and as such able to be substituted with one another without changing the truth value of the sentence. Consider the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>James believes that Samuel Clemens was less than 5 feet tall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming James is unaware that Clemens wrote under the name “Mark Twain” and that he’s seen a picture of Mark Twain in a mask and thinks he looks taller than 5 feet we cannot substitute “Samuel Clemens” with “Mark Twain” without changing the truth value of the sentence. Seems like meaning isn’t determined solely by reference.</p>
<h2 id="iii-definite-descriptions-and-the-russellian-paraphrase-">III. Definite Descriptions and the Russellian Paraphrase.</h2>
<p>Using the above problems Russell argues that (specifically) definite descriptions have meaning beyond their referents. Russell’s Theory of Descriptions takes the form of a contextual definition of the word “the” as it occurs in the typical definite description. Russell offers a paraphrase for the standard type of sentence containing “the,” to reveal the sentence&#39;s logical form. Consider the paradigmatic sentence of the form “The F is G”:</p>
<ul>
<li>The author of “Waverly” was Scotch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sentence appears to be of simple subject-predicate form. It refers to an individual and predicates something about him. Note the “the” in front of the predicative expression and note that the meaning of the expression figures in our ability to pick out the referent of the expression. Russell suggests that “the” abbreviates the following more complex logical expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least one person authored “Waverly”. [∃x(Wx)]</p>
</li>
<li><p>At most one person authored “Waverly”. [∀x(Wx ⇒ ∀y(Wy ⇒ (y=x)))]</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whoever authored “Waverly” was Scotch. [∀x(Wx ⇒ Sx)]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The above propositions are necessary for the truth of the sentence. If the author of “Waverly” was Scotch, then there was such an author, and if there were more than one author, “the” should not have been used. Furthermore, if the author is Scotch it follows trivially that who did the authoring is as well. As such the above three propositions together seem sufficient for the truth of the sentence. We have a set of individually necessary and jointly sufficient statements for the truth of the sentence. The three propositions above are conjointly equivalent to</p>
<ul>
<li>∃x(Wx ∧ [∀y(Wy ⇒ (y = x)) ∧ Sx])</li>
</ul>
<p>Russell believes that the above expresses the logical form of the sentence distinct from the superficial grammatical form of the sentence. This means the apparent singular term in the sentence “The author of ‘Waverly’” is not a singular term at all but rather a convenient abbreviation of the more complicated quantified logical form displayed above. The apparent singular term disappears on analysis. These puzzles arise from applying principles about singular references to expressions that aren’t singular terms. Here’s how this analysis solves the three problems given.</p>
<h2 id="iv-how-russell-s-theory-provides-a-solution-">IV. How Russell’s theory provides a solution.</h2>
<h3 id="1-problem-of-reference-to-non-existents">1. Problem of reference to Non-Existents</h3>
<p>Consider the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The present King of France is bald.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a sentence is meaningless on a Referential Theory because the King of France doesn’t exist. The sentence still seems meaningful, the answer we want should be a value of False to the sentence. Let’s give the Russellian paraphrase of the sentence.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least one person is presently King of France. [∃x(Kx)]</p>
</li>
<li><p>At most one person is presently King of France. [∀x(Kx ⇒ ∀y(Ky ⇒ (y=x)))]</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whoever is presently King of France is bald. [∀x(Kx ⇒ Bx)]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of the three conjuncts is just going to be false, meaning the sentence is going to come out false on Russell’s analysis. That’s good we have a solution! Russell’s solution is to reject P2 of propositions P1-P6, “The sentence is of the subject-predicate form“ since he rejects that “The present King of France” is a singular term. It only has a subject-predicate form in a superficial grammatical way. (An alternative way of viewing this is keeping P2, understanding that it alludes to superficial grammatical form, and rejecting P3 because superficial subject-predicate sentences can be meaningful without picking out any particular individual because it abbreviates to a set of general statements.)</p>
<p>Lets look at a subset of the problem of reference to non-existents, the problem of negative existentials. Take the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>The present King of France does not exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re given the following Russellian paraphrase:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least one person is presently King of France.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At most one person is presently King of France.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whoever is presently King of France does not exist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The supposed problem is clear, the first conjunct asserts the existence of a present King, while the third conjunct denies it. To make sense of the sentence we must understand &quot;not&quot; as applying to the whole sentence rather than modifying just the verb “exist”. As a result of doing so the sentence is:</p>
<ul>
<li>¬(The present King of France does not exist.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we apply Russell’s analysis to the inside of the negation giving us</p>
<ul>
<li>¬(At least one person is presently King of France ∧ At most one person is presently King of France ∧ Whoever is presently King of France exists)</li>
</ul>
<p>The intuitive content of the sentence is “No one is uniquely King of France” Nowhere in his analysis do we pick out an individual and say that he does not exist, the problem of negative existentials vanishes as such.</p>
<h3 id="2-problem-of-identity">2. Problem of Identity</h3>
<p>Consider the sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” is Samuel Clemens.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the left-hand term is a definite description, the Russellian paraphrase is as follows</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least one person is presently author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”. [∃x(Ax)]</p>
</li>
<li><p>At most one person is presently author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”. [∀x(Ax ⇒ ∀y(Ay ⇒ (y=x)))]</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whoever is presently author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” is Samuel Clemens. [∀x(Ax ⇒ (x=s))]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can see why the original identity statement is nontrivial. We learn something new when we hear Russell’s paraphrase, something substantive about Samuel Clemens and the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”. The Russellian Theory of Descriptions seems to give the correct account of the identity statements&#39; cognitive value. On Russell’s view, it&#39;s only superficially an identity statement, rather it’s the predication and attribution of a complex relation property to Samuel Clemens.</p>
<h3 id="3-problem-of-substitution">3. Problem of Substitution</h3>
<p>Consider the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>James believes that the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” is a good writer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume that James doesn’t know that the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn“ also wrote “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” and that James believes the author of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” is a hack writer. Since the definite descriptions occur as part of what James believes we shall start the Russellian paraphrase with “James believes” and then give the Russellian Paraphrase.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least one person authored “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn“</p>
</li>
<li><p>At most one person authored “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn“</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whoever authored “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn“ is a good writer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems like a good account of what James believes, and it’s obvious now why we can’t substitute the author of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn“ with the author of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” as the corresponding Russellian Paraphrase is going to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At least one person authored “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer”</p>
</li>
<li><p>At most one person authored “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whoever authored “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” is a good writer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This attributes a different belief to James as such it makes sense that it is false even though the sentence “James believes that the author of ‘The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn’ is a good writer.” is true. At the level of logical form, we have not made a substitution at all!</p>
<h2 id="v-how-russell-s-view-fails-">V. How Russell’s view fails.</h2>
<p>So far Russell’s view seems like a good account of meaning. So why do I reject it? Let’s give some possible objections and see if they succeed or fail. Note the first failure, dealing with Anaphoric expressions. </p>
<h3 id="1-anaphora">1. Anaphora</h3>
<p>Anaphoric expressions inherit meaning from another expression, its antecedent, which usually occurs earlier in the sentence or a previous sentence. Take the following example</p>
<ul>
<li>“The man who lived around the corner was eccentric. He used to snack on turtle heads.”</li>
</ul>
<p>“he” refers back to the man who lived around the corner. Geach calls these “pronouns of laziness” and suggests that it’s merely an abbreviation of a repetition of the antecedent phrase and so the second clause is equivalent to</p>
<ul>
<li>“The man who lived around the corner used to snack on turtle heads.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If Geach is right then the sentence poses no problems for Russell&#39;s Theory of Descriptions; its second clause would be analyzed in the usual manner and that analysis seems correct. However, Evans points out an issue, a parallel treatment fails when the antecedent is a quantifier phrase or an indefinite description. Consider the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Just one turtle came down the street. It was running as if it were being pursued by a maniac.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The sentence&#39;s second clause isn’t equivalent to “Just one turtle was running as if…” because the latter might be false even when the sentence is true. Consider the following sentence as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>“A rabbit appeared in our yard after dinner. It seemed unconcerned.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This sentence&#39;s second clause is not equivalent to “A rabbit seems unconcerned” as the paraphrase misses the fact that the original “it” referred to the particular rabbit that appeared in the yard.</p>
<p>Russell may respond that what he offered was a theory of definite descriptions and that neither of the above sentences contains definite descriptions. However, if the “its” in the above are not pronouns of laziness why would we think the “he” in the Geach example is? Furthermore, definite descriptions can themselves be anaphors, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>“A rabbit appeared in our yard after dinner. The rabbit seemed unconcerned.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If “The rabbit” abbreviates to “The rabbit that appeared in our yard after dinner” then by the usual clause of uniqueness in the Russellian paraphrase the above sentence entails that at most one rabbit appeared in the yard, but the sentence itself doesn’t seem to entail that as it is logically consistent with more than one rabbit’s having appeared in the yard. A speaker who utters the sentence does suggest that there was only one but it wouldn’t be a contradiction for them to add “In fact, there were several rabbits, and none of them looked very worried.”</p>
<h3 id="2-determinate-particular-descriptions">2. Determinate particular descriptions</h3>
<p>Recall the paradoxes introduced earlier for the Referential theory of meaning. Russell’s Theory of Description seems to dissolve these problems but we have only worked with definite descriptions. These paradoxes are paradoxes for all singular terms, not just descriptions. So Russell gives an account of Definite terms that solves these issues but at best his theory only seems to apply to a special subset of singular terms. Any adequate solution needs to be generalized to all singular terms. Russell’s solution to this is ingenious. He claims everyday proper names aren’t genuine Millian names despite looking like and sounding like names when spoken aloud. They aren’t names at the level of logical form, rather they are equivalent to definite descriptions. Just shorthand and not much more.</p>
<p>If Russell is correct, his solution to the puzzles does generalize because names are just shorthand for definite descriptions. He gives a few arguments for his thesis. First, he maintains that a sentence containing a definite description entails the three conjuncts that make up the Russellian paraphrase and argues the same is true of sentences with proper names. Consider the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Pegasus does not exist.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The sentence is obviously true but in virtue of what? It doesn’t pick out an existing thing and assert falsely that it’s non-existent. It simply asserts that there is in fact no such winged horse.</p>
<p>The second argument invokes a clarificatory question. Suppose you hear someone use a name you aren’t familiar with. When you ask who the speaker is talking about they’ll give descriptions of the person. If you don’t know the name you’re hearing you ask a “who” question and are answered in the form of a description.</p>
<p>So this view isn’t immediately absurd and has some support, it falls apart upon further questioning, however. Searle notes that if proper names are equivalent to descriptions then for each name there must be some particular description that is equivalent to it. Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Wilfrid Sellars was an honest man.”</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the particular description given you know a fair number of individuating facts about Sellars? Suppose that “Wilfrid Sellars” is equivalent to “The one and only thing x such that x is F and x is G and x is …” where F, G, and the rest of the set of predicates are all the predicates that you would believe apply to the man. This view has consequences as it entails the following</p>
<ul>
<li>“There is at least one philosopher with whom I had a fairly violent argument in George Pappas’ living room in 1979.”</li>
</ul>
<p>and it doesn’t seem like “Wilfrid Sellars was an honest man” entails “There is at least one philosopher with whom I had a fairly violent argument in George Pappas’ living room in 1979”</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s not clear that there is a single determinate description that the speaker has in mind when uttering some name. If you ask “Who is Sellars?” there are a lot of different answers that come to mind depending on what information I think you may want about them. That doesn’t mean the answer produced is the precise description that the use of “Sellars” antecedently expressed.</p>
<h3 id="3-multiple-definite-descriptions">3. Multiple Definite Descriptions</h3>
<p>It’s also the case that different people know different things about people. Assuming Russell is correct it follows that the same name will have many different senses for different people. If names are equivalent to definite descriptions, they are equivalent to different definite descriptions for different people. Suppose you are thinking about Wilfrid Sellars as “the author of ‘Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man’” and suppose I am thinking of Sellars as “Pittsburgh’s most famous philosopher.” We would be unable to disagree about Sellars. If you said “Sellars used to tie his shoes with one hand” and I responded “Sellars did no such thing,” on Russell’s view we wouldn’t be in contradiction with each other. What you said would be</p>
<ul>
<li>One and only one person wrote “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man,” and whoever wrote “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man” used to tie his shoes with one hand</li>
</ul>
<p>What I say would be</p>
<ul>
<li>One and only one person was a philosopher more famous than any other in Pittsburgh, and whoever was a philosopher more famous than any other in Pittsburgh did no such thing as tie his shoes with one hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>And both statements don’t entail a contradiction. We wouldn’t actually be disputing each other. That seems incorrect.</p>
<h3 id="4-modal-talk">4. Modal Talk</h3>
<p>Suppose “Obama” is equivalent to “the first black president of the U.S.” and consider the following modal question:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Could Obama have not been the first black president of the U.S.?”</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer seems to obviously be yes assuming “could” expresses some form of alethic or nomic possibility. However, on Russell’s Theory of Description, the question is shorthand for</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible that (◊): one and only person was the first black president and whoever was the first black president wasn’t the first black president?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to this is no on pain of absurdity. Michael Dummett disputes this objection. He claims we only infer that our modal question is synonymous with the above if “Obama” is equivalent to a description at all, it is equivalent to one that has a narrow scope. If the relevant description has wide scope then our original question is synonymous with the below:</p>
<ul>
<li>One and only one person was the first black president and concerning whoever was the first black president, is it possible (◊) that that person wasn’t the first black president.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above sentence is clumsy; there are other irrelevant disambiguations of our question because the interrogative operator itself has scope, so let’s make the point more simple by using just the indicative versions of the two readings, the sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) “Is it possible for Obama to not have been the first black president of the U.S.?”</li>
</ul>
<p>presuming “Obama” is equivalent to “the first black president of the U.S.” is ambiguous between the narrow-scope reading and wide-scope reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Narrow-scope: ◊[∃x(Bx ∧ ∀y(By ⇒ (y=x)) ∧ ∀z(Bz ⇒ ¬Bz))]</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wide-scope: ∃x(Bx ∧ ∀y(By ⇒ (y=x)) ∧ ∀z(Bz ⇒ ◊¬Bz))</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The former corresponds to sentence a and is false, while the latter is presumably true. In a similar move, we can rigidify the descriptions in terms of which they explicate. So “Obama” can be seen not as “The first black president of the U.S.” but as “the actual first black president of the U.S.” as such there’s reason to be skeptical of this objection.</p>
<h2 id="5-g-del-theft-objection">5. Gödel Theft objection</h2>
<p>Kripke offers a hypothetical regarding Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. Imagine that the theorem was actually proven in the 1920s by a man named Schmidt who died before publishing it. Gödel came along and published it under his name. Now, most people know Gödel as the man who proved the Incompleteness Theorem. When people who know nothing else about Gödel utter his name it seems as if they’re still referring to Gödel rather than to this unknown Schmidt. When they say:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Gödel proved the Incompleteness Theorem.”</li>
</ul>
<p>they are simply speaking falsely. However on Russell’s view, Gödel is just going to be shorthand for “The person who proved the Incompleteness Theorem” meaning the person who knows Gödel for nothing else isn’t expressing a false belief at all, they’re uttering a true proposition about the unknown Schmidt. This seems implausible.</p>
<h2 id="6-cicero-is-tully-objection">6. Cicero is Tully objection</h2>
<p>Kripke gives further objections. Consider the following sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Some people are unaware that Cicero is Tully.”</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems true but if Russell’s thesis is correct, it’s hard to interpret the above sentence as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“there is no single proposition denoted by the ‘that’ clause, that the community of normal English speakers expresses by ‘Cicero is Tully’” (Kripke 1979b: 245)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As &quot;Cicero” and “Tully” are equivalent to different descriptions for different people there is no single fact of the matter by which the sentence says some people are unaware.</p>
<h3 id="7-unique-descriptions-objection">7. Unique Descriptions objection</h3>
<p>If Russell is correct then all proper names are shorthand for definite descriptions that apply uniquely to the name’s referent. This seems false however, most people associate “Cicero” only with “a famous Roman orator” even though that description can apply to any famous Roman orator. Furthermore, two proper names for the same person (take for example “Cicero” and “Tully” as above.) can have the same indefinite description and when they do Russell’s theory cannot explain their continuing failure to substitute in belief contexts.</p>
<h2 id="vi-final-notes-">VI. Final Notes.</h2>
<p>It’s important to note Searle offers a looser and more sophisticated variant of Russell’s Descriptivist Theory to account for a few of these objections. It’s not the view this article tries to address so I didn’t mention it but I will just add here that it gets around a few of these objections, namely the determinate particular descriptions objection and the multiple definite descriptions, however, it’s not clear how the view addresses the Gödel objection or the Cicero Tully objection. Furthermore, there is another objection that can possibly be levied at the Russellian theory when accounting for fictional names but it’s not clear the argument would sway Russell as he would not be inclined to say that sentences about fictional names are true as opposed to being “make-belief true” or “True in fiction”.</p></div>
